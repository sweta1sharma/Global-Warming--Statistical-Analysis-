As per NASAâ€™s study on Global Warming, the average temperature has increased by over 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880.We wanted to explore climate data to identify the relationship between temperature levels and concentrations of emission in the atmosphere and other factors. We use linear models to understand the advantages and shortcomings of such models in explaining the variation in the independent variable.

Conclusion: As per our linear model, 73.46% of the variance in Average Global Temp, at 95% confidence levels, can be explained by predictors such as the concentration of emissions, solar irradiance, and El Nino oscillation considered in the model.
